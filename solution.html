    <div>Although climate change is already at a stage where the effects are quite bad, and we are already getting record-breaking temperatures, it's not too late to fix the problem. All we need to do is simply reduce the population or reduce the greenhouse gas emissions. This can be done in a variety of ways, for one, we could add population rules, similar to China's past attempt, except it wouldn't need to be as dramatic as the one-child policy, even having a two child policy would reduce the population. Most populations around the world are now self regulating population numbers, however Africa's population continues to grow. <br> <img src="images/trees.jpg" alt="Trees" height="240" width="300"><img src="images/garden.jpg" alt="City"><br>Also, to reduce gas emissions we could start using new electric technology, such as electric cars that don't produce any greenhouse gasses We could use clean energy such as solar, wind and hydroelectric dams. Studies show that if the top ten per cent of people (in terms of wealth) reduced their emissions to the EU average, global emissions would drop by 35%.<br>Climate change is a major world issue, and we need to do something to stop it. But it's not too late, there's still hope, and things are being done to solve it, but you can help too. Simply catching public transport instead of driving or turning off your AC unit when you don't need it, and just doing what you can to reduce emissions. Also make a concious decision to only have two or less children.
