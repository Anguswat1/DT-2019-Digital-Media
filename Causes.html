    <div> Climate change, in part, is caused by humans, and all the carbon emitting technology we have created, farming practices we have implemented and deforestation we have undertaken. Global warming is predominantly caused by our emission of greenhouse gasses, which is mostly produced by the burning of fossil fuels. For example, cars, planes and even fridges and air conditioning units produce these gases.<br><br><img src="pollution.jpg" alt="Pollution" height="400" width="600"> <br> Although the release of greenhouse gasses such as carbon monoxide are the main problem, there is another contributing factor that is even more vital to climate change than the release of gasses. That factor is over population. Overpopulation means that there are more people in the world than can be sustained, meaning there are more cars, more pollutants being produced, more resources being used than need to be, etc. This is the cause of the huge release of greenhouse gasses, it's the cause of all pollution and also the cause of deforestation, which only leads to an increase of greenhouse gasses, as there are fewer trees to convert the greenhouse gasses into Oxygen.</div>
