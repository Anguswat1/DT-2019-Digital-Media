    <div>The release of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere causes them to build-up, creating an insulation barrier around the earth, the gas layer traps heat from the sun, preventing it from leaving the atmosphere, and therefore heats up the earth, (similar to how you would add pink bats into a home to conserve heat). This then causes a multitude of problems throughout the earth. Firstly, the increase in temperature causes the ice caps to melt, which in turn causes habitat loss that leads to the endangerment of species such as the Polar Bears, and it will also cause the oceans to rise, permanently flooding many low-lying areas of the world, in some cases entire countries.<br> <img src="images/storm.jpg" alt="Storm" height="300" width="400"><img src="images/desert.jpg" alt="Drought" height="300" width="400"> <br> The Change in the climate also causes a change in weather patterns, in some parts of the world there are major heatwaves and droughts, the likes of such never seen before, and in other areas huge storms, and mass flooding. The release of gasses also causes the air quality to decrease which can cause illness and even acidic rain. Climate change is a serious issue and it threatens the earth we live on, which is why it is so urgent we do something to reduce the damage as soon as possible.</div>
